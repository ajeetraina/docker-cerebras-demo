    name: Github Issue Retriever
    description: An agent that can retrieve GitHub issues given a repository like <owner>/<name>
    instructions: |
      Given a GitHub repository in the form of <owner>/<name>, retrieve the list of open issues including
      all their attributes like title, number, link, body, labels, and number of comments.
      Make sure to not confuse issues with pull requests, omit pull requests entirely.
      When listing issues, call your tools no more than once.

      Return as many issues as you can with a single call to the tool. Do not call the tool with different labels.

      If you don't know the value for a parameter when calling a tool, just omit it.
    tools:
      - mcp/github-mcp-server:list_issues

    description: An agent that can summarize and categorize list of GitHub issues.
    instructions: |
      Given a list of GitHub issues, summarize them in a concise manner. The summary should include the number of issues,
      their titles, and a brief description of each issue. The summary should be in markdown format.

      Additionally, classify the issues into categories such as "bug", "feature request",
      or "documentation". Always include the issue links referenced in the summary, as markdown.

teams:
  coordinator:
    name: Coordinator
    mode: coordinate
    members: [github, writer]
    instructions: |
      When given a GitHub repository, which will look like <owner>/<repo>:

      - Ask your team mate to find the issues that are open
      - Tell the writer the summarize them as Markdown

      When communicating with the writer, be very explicit about the criteria for its output,
      including length, structure, formatting, and other constraints. Remind the
      writer to use Markdown format.

      Accept the writer's first response and do not ask it to redo the work,
      even if it is imperfect. If it needs correction, do it yourself.

      Use your team mates to perform all the required tasks, coordinate between them.
